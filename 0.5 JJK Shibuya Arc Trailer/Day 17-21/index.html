                <p class="synopsis">
                    Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his 
                    days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely 
                    lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of 
                    supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from 
                    human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, 
                    the King of Curses.
                    Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. 
                    Introduced to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path 
                    of a Jujutsu sorcerer.
